# <span style="color: blue;">Introduction</span>

This article provides a tutorial about using R in VS Code through SSH server, the processes are normally the same when you use R in your local computer.

# <span style="color: blue;">Install Visual Studio Code</span>

Use the official [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) website to download and install Visual Studio Code matching your local computer system.

# <span style="color: blue;">Install R</span>

Use the official [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) website to download and install R matching your server system.

# <span style="color: blue;">Install Python</span>

Use the official [Python](https://www.python.org/) website to download and install Python matching your server system.

# <span style="color: blue;">Install Extensions</span>

Install the extensions in the following picture in Visual Studio Code

![**Install extensions: Python, Pylance, R, R Debugger**](Extensions.png)

# <span style="color: blue;">Install Required R package</span>

Open R environment in the terminal in your Visual Studio Code. If you don't know the R version in your computer, just type `R` then click `TAB` on your keyboard twice, it will return the R version in your system, if it returns `R-4.1.2`, then type `R-4.1.2` in the terminal, you will enter a R environment.
```r
install.packages("languageserver")
packageVersion("languageserver")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
packageVersion("rmarkdown")
install.packages("httpgd")
packageVersion("httpgd")
```
Enable `r.plot.useHttpgd` in Visual Studio Code settings: Open Visual Studio Code setting, copy `r.plot.useHttpgd` to the search bar, then check the box.

# <span style="color: blue;">Install Radian</span>

[Radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian) is highly recommended as the R terminal for interactive use. It requires Python which should be available on most Linux distributions out of the box.
To install it globally:
```r
pip install -U radian
```
or
```r
pip3 install -U radian
```
Or if you don't have root privilege, you may want to install it only for yourself:
```r
pip install --user radian
```
or
```r
pip3 install --user radian
```
Enable `r.bracketedPaste` in Visual Studio Code settings: Open Visual Studio Code setting, copy `r.bracketedPaste` to the search bar, then check the box.

# <span style="color: blue;">Environment Setting</span>

Type the following commands in the termial: Suppose your R version in your environemnt is R-4.1.2
```r
which(R-4.1.2)
which(radian)
```
This will return the paths for **R** and **radian**. Suppose your **R** path is `/home/user/.local/bin/R-4.1.2`, **radian** path is `/home/user/.local/bin/radian`, then

* Search `r.rterm.linux` in Visual Studio Code setting, type your **radian** path here, such as `/home/user/.local/bin/radian`

* Search `r.rpath.linux` in Visual Studio Code setting, type your **R** path here, such as `/home/user/.local/bin/R-4.1.2`

* Search `r.rterm.option` in Visual Studio Code setting, click `Add Item`, type `--r-binary=/home/user/.local/bin/R-4.1.2`, then save the change, remember change the **R** path to the **R** path in your own environment.

# <span style="color: blue;">Other Option</span>

You can also use the following code to install anaconda and use it to create a R environment, then following all the processes above.
```r 
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh
conda --version
conda create -n my-r-env r-base
conda activate my-r-env
R --version
R
q()
conda deactivate
```

If you want to enter `bash` automatically when you create a new terminal, you can search `terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux`, then select `bash`.
